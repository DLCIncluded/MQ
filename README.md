# Monotropism Questionnaire

**BEFORE YOU BEGIN!!! I am not a doctor**. I am a bored webdev who thinks self diagnosing is valid. This is not diagnosing anything, compare your scores to the results of the data from the initial validation study and continue to research. Thank you for the team involved in this study for putting together the questionnaire, and all those who have made suggestions and helped make this app better.

Questions taken directly from:  [https://osf.io/4wru2](https://osf.io/4wru2)  and  [scored based on their findings](https://osf.io/g4kc9).

I  **do not own**  the questions, or content in the questions; I do not store or collect this information please see the source code if you are concerned it is  [open source](https://github.com/DLCIncluded/MQ).  **All processing is done in YOUR browser in memory, no data will ever be sent to me, or anyone else.**  If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions please go to the github repo  [here](https://github.com/DLCIncluded/MQ)  and submit an issue, and I will be glad to assist!

All this site is for is to make taking the questionnaire easier, and I was bored, and too lazy to tally up the score myself... and yes I know that making this site was far more work than just doing a bit of adding...
